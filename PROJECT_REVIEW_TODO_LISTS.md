# SkinStack Project Review & To-Do Lists

## 📋 1. ISSUES FOUND - Critical Problems to Fix

### 🔴 Critical Security Issues
- [ ] **URGENT: Remove exposed database credentials from .env and settings.py**
  - Database password is exposed in plain text
  - Settings.py has hardcoded credentials
  - Different credentials in settings.py vs .env file

### 🔴 Breaking Errors
- [ ] Fix import error in `api/routes/webhooks.py` - `DatabasePool` class not defined
- [ ] Fix incorrect import in `webhooks.py` - should import `db` from `lib.db`
- [ ] Add missing SQL function `process_webhook_idempotently` referenced in code

### 🟡 Architecture Issues
- [ ] Resolve duplicate/conflicting API implementations (`core_api.py` vs `api/main.py`)
  - Two different API servers with overlapping functionality
  - Unclear which should be used in production
- [ ] Fix inconsistent database URL formats across files
- [ ] Fix Python version mismatch (pyproject.toml targets 3.12, code uses 3.13)

### 🟡 Missing Critical Files
- [ ] Add missing `requirements.txt` file (referenced in README)
- [ ] Add missing `.env.example` file (referenced in README)
- [ ] Add missing Docker configuration files (mentioned in README)
- [ ] Add missing `test_click_performance.py` (referenced in README)
- [ ] Add missing dependencies to pyproject.toml or requirements.txt

### 🟡 Incomplete Implementations
- [ ] Implement missing webhook signature validation for Shopify
- [ ] Implement missing API endpoints (Impact, Amazon, Levanta webhooks)
- [ ] Add missing workers directory implementation
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins (currently allows all origins - security risk)

### 🟠 Deprecation Warnings
- [ ] Fix Redis deprecation warning - use `aclose()` instead of `close()`
- [ ] Update deprecated Redis connection methods in `validate_everything.py`

---

## 🔧 2. TROUBLESHOOTING TO-DO LIST

### Step 1: Fix Breaking Issues (Do First)
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with all dependencies:
  ```
  fastapi==0.104.1
  uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
  asyncpg==0.29.0
  redis==5.0.1
  pydantic==2.5.0
  pydantic-settings==2.1.0
  python-jose[cryptography]==3.3.0
  passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4
  httpx==0.25.2
  python-dotenv==1.0.0
  ```

- [ ] Fix `api/routes/webhooks.py` import:
  ```python
  from lib.db import db  # Change from DatabasePool
  ```

- [ ] Create `.env.example` file with sanitized values

- [ ] Run migration to add missing SQL function:
  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_webhook_idempotently(...)
  ```

### Step 2: Resolve Architecture Conflicts
- [ ] Decide on single API implementation:
  - Option A: Use `api/main.py` (modular, cleaner)
  - Option B: Use `core_api.py` (monolithic, more complete)
  - Recommendation: Migrate features from `core_api.py` to modular `api/` structure

- [ ] Standardize database connection approach
- [ ] Remove hardcoded credentials from `lib/settings.py`

### Step 3: Security Hardening
- [ ] Move all credentials to environment variables
- [ ] Implement proper secret management
- [ ] Add webhook signature validation
- [ ] Configure CORS properly with allowed origins
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware

### Step 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Run `validate_everything.py` to check system health
- [ ] Test all API endpoints
- [ ] Verify webhook idempotency
- [ ] Check query performance metrics
- [ ] Test Redis caching functionality
